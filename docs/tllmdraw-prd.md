### **1\. Introduction & Vision**

**Nexus Canvas** is a unified, AI-powered design and collaboration platform that seamlessly integrates a visual whiteboard with a multifaceted intelligent assistant. It's designed to be the ultimate environment for teams to brainstorm, design, plan, and createâ€”from the first spark of an idea to a fully-realized prototype. By combining the freeform creativity of a tool like Miro, the design precision of Figma, and the intelligence of a next-gen AI assistant with voice and recording capabilities, Nexus Canvas eliminates friction and supercharges creative and development workflows.

**Our Vision:** To create a single source of truth where collaborative work is not just easier, but smarter, more intuitive, and exponentially more powerful.

### **2\. The Problem**

Creative, design, and development teams currently rely on a fragmented ecosystem of tools. A typical workflow might involve:

* Brainstorming in Miro or on a physical whiteboard.  
* Translating those ideas into wireframes and mockups in Figma or Sketch.  
* Managing the project in Jira or Trello.  
* Documenting requirements in Confluence or Google Docs.  
* Communicating via Slack and Zoom.

This constant context-switching is inefficient, leads to information silos, and creates a "translation gap" where valuable context is lost between stages. There is no single environment that understands the entire lifecycle of a project from ideation to execution.

### **3\. Target Audience & Personas**

Nexus Canvas is for anyone involved in the creation of digital products and services.

* **Product Managers:** To create roadmaps, user flows, and manage project requirements in a visual, integrated space.  
* **UX/UI Designers:** To move seamlessly from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity, interactive prototypes.  
* **Software Developers:** To understand system architecture, visualize API structures, and even generate boilerplate code directly from diagrams.  
* **Marketing & Strategy Teams:** To brainstorm campaigns, create mind maps, and collaborate on strategic planning.  
* **Founders & Innovators:** To sketch out business ideas, pitch concepts, and manage their vision in one place.

### **4\. Goals & Success Metrics**

* **Goal:** Become the primary tool for team brainstorming and design prototyping.  
  * **Metric:** High user stickiness (Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users ratio).  
  * **Metric:** High rate of feature adoption across all toolkits (Design, Business, etc.).  
* **Goal:** Reduce the time it takes for teams to move from idea to prototype.  
  * **Metric:** Measure average project time from "New Canvas" creation to "Prototype Shared."  
  * **Metric:** User surveys on perceived efficiency gains.  
* **Goal:** Foster a deeply collaborative and intelligent working environment.  
  * **Metric:** Number of real-time collaborative sessions per week.  
  * **Metric:** Frequency of AI assistant interactions per session.

### **5\. Features & Requirements**

#### **5.1. Core: The Canvas & Chat Interface**

* **Visual Canvas (based on TLdraw):** An infinite canvas supporting drawing, shapes, text, images, and connectors. Must be highly performant and intuitive.  
* **Real-time Collaboration:** Multiple users can create and edit on the canvas simultaneously, with visible cursors and presence indicators.  
* **AI Chat Panel:** A persistent side panel for interacting with the AI assistant. Maintains conversational context.

#### **5.2. Communication Layer**

* **Voice Integration:**  
  * **Speech-to-Text:** Users can issue commands and dictate text to the AI or canvas using their voice.  
  * **Text-to-Speech:** The AI assistant can respond with voice, providing a more natural interaction.  
* **Screencast & Recording:**  
  * **Canvas Recording:** Natively record all activity on the canvas, capturing the creative process.  
  * **Audio Narration:** Capture microphone audio alongside the canvas recording to create guided walkthroughs and presentations.  
* **Sharing & Collaboration Modes:**  
  * **Live Broadcast:** Share a view-only link for presentations or large-scale meetings.  
  * **Full Collaboration:** Invite users with full editing permissions.  
  * **Async Comments:** Allow users to leave comments and annotations on specific elements for feedback.

#### **5.3. Design & Prototyping Toolkit**

* **UI Component Library:** A library of pre-built, customizable UI elements (buttons, forms, cards, navbars, modals).  
* **Wireframing Tools:** Device frames (phone, tablet, desktop), grids, and layout guides to structure designs.  
* **Interactive Prototyping:** Ability to link different frames/screens together, define click/tap targets, and set up basic page transitions (e.g., slide, fade).  
* **API Mockup Tools:** A visual interface to design API endpoints, define request/response data structures (JSON), and link them to the prototype.

#### **5.4. Business & Software Planning Tools**

* **Diagram Templates:** One-click templates for Flowcharts, User Journeys, System Architecture Diagrams, and ERDs.  
* **Project Management Views:**  
  * **Kanban Board:** Convert sticky notes or cards into a Kanban board to track progress.  
  * **Gantt Chart / Timeline:** Generate project timelines from task cards.  
* **Brainstorming Suite:**  
  * **Mind Maps:** Tools specifically for creating and expanding mind maps.  
  * **Sticky Notes:** Digital sticky notes with various colors.  
  * **Voting/Prioritization:** Allow collaborators to vote on ideas or elements.

#### **5.5. AI Assistant Capabilities**

* **Observational & Analytical:**  
  * **"What's on the canvas?":** The AI can read and summarize the contents of the workspace.  
  * **"Organize this brainstorm":** Automatically group related sticky notes or ideas into clusters.  
  * **"Convert this sketch to a diagram":** Transform a rough hand-drawn flowchart into a clean, structured diagram using the component library.  
* **Generative & Creative:**  
  * **"Generate a login screen layout":** Create a UI layout based on a text description.  
  * **"Create a user flow for a password reset":** Generate the necessary frames and connectors for a common user journey.  
  * **"Suggest an API structure for user authentication":** Generate a visual API mockup.  
* **Code Generation:**  
  * **Prototype to Code:** Generate basic HTML/CSS or React component code for a designed element or screen.

### **6\. Out of Scope (for V1)**

* Advanced animations and micro-interactions in prototyping.  
* Full-fledged version control system (like Git). V1 will have a simple change history.  
* Third-party integrations (Jira, Slack, etc.).  
* Native desktop or mobile applications. This will be a web-first platform.
